## Introduction
Academic performance of students is always a concern not only to themselves, but also to their parents, teacher and society once they enter working environment. There is a lot of factors that are actually affecting the students in concentrating to their academic subjects, cause a bad result overally. This project is done to investigate on them.

## Problem Statement/ Questions proposed
i.   What are the factors that can affect grade of students?
ii.  How much do these factors affect grade of the students?
iii. What is the relationship between these factors?

## Possible stakeholder
Our product is created on the purpose helping predicting the grade of students under conditions and show for various factor affecting academic performance of students. We believe that this product could be useful to users like **teachers**, **parents** and even **students**.

## Data Acquisition 
In completing this assignment, R being used. We focus on data extraction, cleaning, analysis and finally visualisation with prediction using Shiny application mainly.
We successfully obtain our data set through online where there 2 data sets inside, where one recording for some variables with result of the students for 3 semester in Mathematics, while another with Portuguese. We selected the data set with Mathematics only, where we had a total of **395 rows and 33 columns** at first. Some variables included inside the data set are *age*, *health status*, *family relationship* and more.

## Data Extraction and Cleaning
First, we set the working directory, and load the data, check for dimension, existence of null value and such for the data set chosen. "student-mat.csv" is the raw data set that is unprocessed where we extract it from the source https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance
```{r}
setwd("D:/WIE2003 Intro to DS/Assignment/Group/student/Grade")
d1=read.table("student-mat.csv",sep=";",header=TRUE)
# Display for number of rows and columns
dim(d1)
# Check for class of the data 
class(d1)
# Check for names of columns with its respective type
str(d1)
# Check for existence of null value inside the data
sum(is.na(d1))
# Remove duplicate data
d1 <- unique(d1)
# Check for summary for whole data
summary(d1)
```
Let us take a look for preview of the data that is not yet processed.
```{r}
head(d1)
```
Some variables such as *school where the student come from, reason choosing the school* being removed since these are not applicable as these are not suitable factors to be considered in affecting grade since we treat this to be a more universal problem.

Columns like *daily and weekly alcohol consumption* being removed as well since proportion of alcohol consumption among students is not significant enough in some countries.
```{r}
d1 <- subset(d1, select=-c(Dalc, Walc, school, reason))
```
Remove the grade for the 3 semester where they would be sum up and processed to form a new column "Average.result"
```{r}
total <- d1$G1 + d1$G2 + d1$G3
Result <- total / 3
d1$Average.result <- Result
d1 <- subset(d1, select=-c(G1, G2, G3))
```
Set yes/no to TRUE/FALSE (levels for factor)
```{r}
d1[d1 == "no"] <- "FALSE"
d1[d1 == "yes"] <- "TRUE"
```
Renaming columns to be a more appropriate names
```{r}
names(d1)[names(d1) == "sex"] <- "Sex"
names(d1)[names(d1) == "age"] <- "Age"
names(d1)[names(d1) == "address"] <- "Address"
names(d1)[names(d1) == "famsize"] <- "Family.size"
names(d1)[names(d1) == "Pstatus"] <- "Parent.s.cohabition.status"
names(d1)[names(d1) == "Medu"] <- "Mother.s.education"
names(d1)[names(d1) == "Fedu"] <- "Father.s.education"
names(d1)[names(d1) == "Mjob"] <- "Mother.s.job"
names(d1)[names(d1) == "Fjob"] <- "Father.s.job"
names(d1)[names(d1) == "guardian"] <- "Guardian"
names(d1)[names(d1) == "traveltime"] <- "Time.from.home.to.school"
names(d1)[names(d1) == "studytime"] <- "Weekly.study.time"
names(d1)[names(d1) == "failures"] <- "Number.of.past.class.failures"
names(d1)[names(d1) == "schoolsup"] <- "Extra.educational.support"
names(d1)[names(d1) == "famsup"] <- "Family.educational.support"
names(d1)[names(d1) == "paid"] <- "Extra.paid.class"
names(d1)[names(d1) == "activities"] <- "Extra.curricular.activity"
names(d1)[names(d1) == "nursery"] <- "Attended.nursery.school"
names(d1)[names(d1) == "higher"] <- "Aims.for.higher.education"
names(d1)[names(d1) == "internet"] <- "Internet.access"
names(d1)[names(d1) == "romantic"] <- "In.romantic.relationship"
names(d1)[names(d1) == "famrel"] <- "Evaluation.for.family.relationship"
names(d1)[names(d1) == "freetime"] <- "Evaluation.for.free.time.after.school"
names(d1)[names(d1) == "goout"] <- "Frequent.going.out.with.friends"
names(d1)[names(d1) == "health"] <- "Current.health.status"
names(d1)[names(d1) == "absences"] <- "Number.of.school.absences"
```
Make columns except **Age**, **Number of school absences** and **"Average result"** to be factor
```{r}
col_names <- names(d1)
col_names <- col_names [-c(2, 26, 27)]
d1[col_names] <- lapply(d1[col_names], factor)
```

## Explotary Data Analysis
Some graphs would be plotted and then remove for some columns based on reasons.
But first, load the suitable library for the visualization
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```
First graph showing for **Sex** and **"Average result"**
```{r}
data1 <- data.frame(Sex = d1$Sex, Average.result = d1$Average.result)
p1 <- ggplot(data1) + geom_col(aes(x=Sex, y=Average.result), position="dodge", fill ="blue") 
p1 <- p1 + labs(title = "Plot of Sex against Average result", x = "Sex", y = "Average result")
p1
```

∴ There is insignificant difference for the two **Sex** attributes with the **"Average result"**, remove **Sex** column is suggested.

To plot following graphs, details below need to be obtained, *count for the factors* of the selected columns need to be known
```{r}
summary(d1$Guardian)
summary(d1$Mother.s.job)
summary(d1$Father.s.job)
```
Pie Chart of **Guardian**
```{r}
countG <- c(90, 273, 32)
labG <- c("father", "mother", "other")
percentG <- round(countG / sum(countG)*100)
labG <- paste(labG, percentG)
labG <- paste(labG, "%", sep = " ")
pG <- pie(countG, labels = labG, col=rainbow(length(labG)), main = "Pie Chart of Guardian")
```

Pie Chart of **Mother's job**
```{r}
countM <- c(59, 24, 141, 103, 58)
labM <- c("at_home", "health", "other", "services", "teacher")
percentM <- round(countM / sum(countM)*100)
labM <- paste(labM, percentM)
labM <- paste(labM, "%", sep = " ")
pM <- pie(countM, labels = labM, col=rainbow(length(labM)), main = "Pie Chart of Mother's job")
```

Pie Chart of **Father's job**
```{r}
countF <- c(20, 18, 217, 111, 29)
labF <- c("at_home", "health", "other", "services", "teacher")
percentF <- round(countF / sum(countF)*100)
labF <- paste(labF, percentF)
labF <- paste(labF, "%", sep = " ")
pF <- pie(countF, labels = labF, col=rainbow(length(labF)), main = "Pie Chart of Father's job")
```

∴ Proportion for "Other and services" are too high for column **Mother's job** and **Father's job**, causing the factor to be considered with parent's job is meaningless. Hence the both columns should be removed.

Make same graph for **Guardian** which is same what did with **Sex** column before
```{r}
data2 <- data.frame(Guardian = d1$Guardian, Average.result = d1$Average.result)
p2 <- ggplot(data2) + geom_col(aes(x=Guardian, y=Average.result), position="dodge", fill = "red") 
p2 <- p2 + labs(title="Plot of Guardian against Average result", x="Guardian", y="Average result")
p2
```

∴ There is insignificant difference for the three **Guardian** attributes with the **"Average result"**, removing **Guardian** column is required

Removing columns **Sex**, **Guardian**, **Mother's job**, and **Father's job**
```{r}
d1 <- d1[-c(1,7,8,9)]
```
Final checking on data processed
```{r}
summary(d1)
```
Write the data set where index row won't be recorded to be stored as another csv, *"Cleaned.csv"*
```{r}
write.csv(d1, "Cleaned.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

## Feature Extraction
Obtain the features that is needed to train the **Random Forest Model**. **as.factor()** is used to convert the variables to be **categorical/ factor variables** which is the same as the data set processed before
```{r}
ds <- read.csv("Cleaned.csv", header=TRUE)

ds.model <- data.frame(
    Age = ds$Age,
    Time.from.home.to.school = as.factor(ds$Time.from.home.to.school),
    Number.of.past.class.failures = as.factor(ds$Number.of.past.class.failures),
    Extra.educational.support = as.factor(ds$Extra.educational.support),
    Family.educational.support = as.factor(ds$Family.educational.support),
    Extra.paid.class = as.factor(ds$Extra.paid.class),
    Extra.curricular.activity = as.factor(ds$Extra.curricular.activity),
    Attended.nursery.school = as.factor(ds$Attended.nursery.school),
    Aims.for.higher.education = as.factor(ds$Aims.for.higher.education),
    Internet.access = as.factor(ds$Internet.access),
    In.romantic.relationship = as.factor(ds$In.romantic.relationship),
    Average.result = ds$Average.result)
```

## Building Prediction Model
Since the average result is a type of **continuous variable**, therefore it is clearly to use **supervised learning regression model**. There are several regression model can be used for our prediction. We choose **Random Forest Regression model** to predict the average result. Random Forest Regression model is an ensemble learning with multiple decision tree. It has the advantages on dealing with non-linearity.

The data set obtained from the feature extraction is split into two, which used for *training (70%) and testing (30%)*. Based on our testing set result, the prediction model has a **root mean square error (rmse) between 3 to 4**, which is relatively moderate.
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load dplyr library
library(dplyr)

# Load randomForest library to use the model
library(randomForest)

# Split the ds.model to train data frame and test data frame
dt <- sort(sample(nrow(ds.model), nrow(ds.model)*0.7))
train <- ds.model[dt,]
test <- ds.model[-dt,]

# Remove the average result from the test data frame
test <- select(test, -Average.result)

# Train the Random Forest model
model <- randomForest(formula=Average.result ~., data=train)

# Finding root mean square error
actual <- select(ds.model[-dt,], Average.result)
names(actual) <- "actual"
predicted <- predict(model, test)
cal_df <- cbind(actual, predicted)
cal_df$error <- cal_df$actual - cal_df$predicted
rmse <- sqrt(mean(cal_df$error^2))
rmse
```

```{r}
# Plot to see the difference between the actual and predicted based on test set
value <- select(cal_df, actual)
names(value) <- "value"
index_value <- c(1:nrow(value))
group <- "Actual"
actual_df <- cbind(value, index_value, group)
value <- select(cal_df, predicted)
names(value) <- "value"
index_value <- c(1:nrow(value))
group <- "Predicted"
predicted_df <- cbind(value, index_value, group)
plot_df <- rbind(actual_df, predicted_df)
ggplot(plot_df, aes(index_value, value, colour=group)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("Comparison between Actual and Predicted Values based on Test Dataset")
```

## Application development
app.R is split into 2 parts, which are ui, in charge of visualizing the dashboard, and server, in charge of manipulation of input and displaying output. There is a total of *3 tabs* for the shiny app we have created, first to be **"About"**, where descriptions of the variable stored and questions proposed would be listed there. Second tab is **"Graph"**, where a jitter/ scatter graph would be shown, based on input by users on X-axis, Y-axis, facet row and also facet column. The last tab is  **"Prediction"**, where users can manipulate for conditions according to their likes to predict average result of the student under the selected conditions. Root mean square error for the prediction and a graph showing the difference between prediction and actual results would be shown as well. 
*Shinydashboard* library is used in beautify the visualization of the product.

```

We have listed the factors that affect the grade of students in **"About"** tab, making some analysis and visualization for determining how factors affecting the grade as well as relationship between the factors in **"Graph"** tab. Further checking on extend factors affecting grade of students can be determined at **"Predict"** tab. 

## Project experience
We learned lot on developing the data product, yet there are still some challenges faced by us in completing the assignment, and they are listed as shown:

i. Defining a good question for the project and finding and appropriate data set regarding the question

ii. Inexperience in operation related to prediction and choosing appropriate prediction model

iii. Communication with teammates is halted because of the online learning environment

iv. Lack of experience in members in R programming language

## Conclusion
There are need for ensuring academic performance of the student to be improved, where this required more effort in determining factors affecting the students and solving them one by one. Suitable helps such as financial support or meeting with parents for further discussion on student's daily life should be determined. This require attention from not only students, but also parents, school, government and even society since these students who will be leading the world in future and academic performance stands for capability of them.
